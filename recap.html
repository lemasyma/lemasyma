							<p>This semester as a Erasmus exchange student have been one of a lifetime experience. One thing we fear as students leaving alone in another country is that there is only two outcomes: either everything seems to have been perfect at the end, either it seems like crap and you feel like you have wasted an amazing opportunity. Happily for me, I feel like the first option.</p>

							<p>When we, Dominique, Styvell, Pierre and myself, chose to apply to the Telecommunication Software course, we were unsure. Our school was not really fond of the idea that second year students apply for a master level class, but we were desesperatly looking for a course to apply to or we would have been short on ECT credits. The course's description was promising, as we were going to use Linux, bash and Python, which we already learn in our school, and we were not disappointed.</p>

							<p>We were actually far better than we thought we were. Finding out we were actually quite qualified for this course was a big surprise, for us and for our school. We thought we were gooing to be left behind, when we were already ahead. However, I am not saying we did not learn anything, in the contrary. We code in Python in our school, but we have nerver used librairies like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib or even sockets for Python servers. As well for coding in R and Bash with AWK, it was brand new for us and it is precious knowledge since when we will back to coding in France, a lot of our projects will be about Linux commands. We learned about so many different subjects, especially ones we will see again later for sure, we are ready to go back to France and show what we learned.</p>
							
							<p>On a more personnal level, I aspire to be a data scientist, and specialized myself in Machine Learning and Big Data in my fourth year (out of five) in my master. I know that NumPy and Matplotlib are privileged librairies when using Python in this domain to compute data. Since a part of my projects are based on them, and the fact that I enjoyed using them quite a lot, I am even more sure to pursue that path, especially since I will already have the most important skills.</p>
