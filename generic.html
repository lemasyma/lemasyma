							<p>This semester as a Erasmus exchange student have been one of a lifetime experience. One thing we fear as students leaving alone in another country is that there is only two outcomes: either everything seems to have been perfect at the end, either it seems like crap and you feel like you have wasted an amazing opportunity. Happily for me, I feel like the first option.</p>

							<p>When we, Dominique, Styvell, Pierre and myself, chose to apply to the Telecommunication Software course, we were unsure. Our school was not really fond of the idea that second year students apply for a master level class, but we were desesperatly looking for a course to apply to or we would have been short on ECT credits. The course's description was promising, as we were going to use Linux, bash and Python, which we already learn in our school, and we were not disapointed.</p>
